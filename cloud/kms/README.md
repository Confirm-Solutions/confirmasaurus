# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.
```
$ cdk synth
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
