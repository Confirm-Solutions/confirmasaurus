# Things I did today

- Created the [confirmasaurus github repo](https://github.com/Confirm-Solutions/confirmasaurus), transferred almost all our github issues there.
- [Anarchy](Anarchy.md) subfolder for doing whatever you want! Tried some collaborative markdown editors.
- [`git subtree`](GitSubtree.md) for letting us work in a single repo while keeping imprint open source. Investigated other options too...
