- Load up VSCode from the root directory. 
- Install the Python and jupyter extension
- Set up unit tests:
	- useful shortcuts: 
		- "cmd + ;" is the prefix for most testing commands
			- "cmd + ;" then "c" runs the test under the cursor
			- "cmd + ;" then "l" runs the last test(s) you ran
			- "cmd + ;" then "f" runs all the tests in the file
			- "cmd + ;" then "e" runs all failed tests
	- you can also run tests in debug mode and set breakpoints, very helpful
	- Open the "Output" panel and go to "Python test log" to see the raw pytest output.
	- If you get "pytest discovery error", go to "Python" in "Output" and find the error and fix it.
