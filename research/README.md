# Research

Create a new folder for whatever you want! This space is uncontrolled. The only rule:
- when your project is done, rename the folder to be `YY_MM_name` where the year and month are the end date of the project. 

Don't expect anything in this folder to be maintained. (We should write some advice on reproducibility. e.g. record git commits, lock dependencies, docker images)
